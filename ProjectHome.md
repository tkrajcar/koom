Koom is a Java-based BattleTech MUX graphical HUD client that is intended as a replacement for both Xpertmud (http://xpertmud.sourceforge.net/) and THUD (http://bt-thud.sourceforge.net/), neither of which is being actively developed.

Koom's authors, known as Casy Eratl/CE and Codicus Unitus/Fiver/CU5, are responsible for all recent (post-2003) THUD development. Our goal is to create a spiritual successor to THUD and we gratefully acknowledge the work of Anthony "Tony" Parker in creating this client, and for the work of Focus and Kip in creating HUDINFO.

So, what's in a name? Well, it's a long and geeky story, but here goes. See, in the Discworld universe by Terry Pratchett, there's a famous battle between dwarves and trolls held in Koom Valley; so famous that it's continually brought up ("Remember Koom Valley!"). The book detailing the events of this battle is named... "Thud!".

So.

Yeah.
